# Hangman

Welcome to the Hangman Challenge by Enrique Torrendell.

The Game

The game has 3 ways of being play: Single, Challenge and Multiplayer. 

- Single

To play the single game, just go to single and start playing. Once you finish the system will show if you won or lost and the amount of points that you earned.

- Challenge

You can only play the challenge game in a daily basis. Once you finish the word of the day you will not be able to play the challenge mode until the next day. 

- Multiplayer

Once you enter you can create a game or play an active game. To create a game, just click in “Create Game” and you will be able to set a title and select up to 3 friends. Then pick the amount of words you want to compete. Creating your own multiplayer game will allow you to have a small leaderboard where you can compete against your friends and track how many points and rounds each user did. Eventually in a future update the idea is to include a chat so you can have fun with your friends.
